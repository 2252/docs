## How it works

### 1. Installation

Then click on the *Install* button, then the *Continue* button, and then click on *Allow* when requested.

### 2. Create Google Sheets

Once the SEO Add-on is installed, you can create a new Google Sheetsâ„¢ document by clicking on this link, [sheets.new](http://sheets.new).

When in Google Sheets, open the SEO Add-on by clicking on the *Extensions* menu, the *WordLift*, and finally *Open*: the sidebar will show.

### 3. Configure Settings

Next step is to configure the **SEO Add-on settings**, click on the Next button in the sidebar.
You'll need a key for the SEO Add-on to work. Normally we prefill the key based on your e-mail address, but if you're using a different e-mail address with Google, you'll need to insert the key yourself.

You can also configure your **target geo market**, **language** and the **Google domain** to use for SERP analysis.

### 4. Run the Entity Analysis 

Start running the Entity analysis is very easy. Once you have set up your SEO add-on, click **Entity Analysis** and follow the steps: Select up to 5 queries or URLs you want to analyze and run the analysis.

The result includes:
- The **list of entities** with links to DBpedia or WiKidata,
- The **confidence level** of each entity (a value from 0 to 1 that takes into account factors such as thematic relevance and contextual ambiguity),
- The **ranking** of the entities in the SERP (this data is obtained during the analysis of the entities to which a query refers),
- The **number of occurrences** in the text (i.e., how often the entity appears in the mentioned content).

You can select the most relevant entities, and the SEO Add-on will automatically create the JSON-LD that you need to copy and past into your website. 

### 5. Get Traffic Data 

To know which search queries you should boost, you can connect the SEO add-on to your Google Search Console and sort the analysis based on your traffic data. Here you will also find a column with the **Opportunity Score**, which suggests which search queries you should target to choose the best ones for your content.

You can now **select the relevant entities**. If you have WordPress with WordLift plugin we can import the entities straight into your knowledge graph, otherwise you can copy the JSON-LD from the sidebar into your own CMS or web page.

## Why is it asking for the country to be added?

This is because Google SERP is different from country to another and the top ranking results can be different. Itâ€™s important to understand that local versions of Google results look different depending on where you are searching from.

## How can the location affect the analysis?

Google's SERP changes depending on the location. Therefore, it is important to enter it before starting the search: only then will the results of the analysis be reliable for the market and audience your company is interested in.
