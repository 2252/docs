# Knowledge Graph

The Knowledge Graph constitutes the basic representation of the Knowledge Domain for a website or an account.

There are several way to populate data in a Knowledge Graph.

In this section you can populate data using:

- URLs by providing a `sitemap.xml` file or manually by using the [Sitemap Import API](./sitemap-import.md) or;
- Crawl data coming from [Botify](./botify.md)

Once the web pages have been imported it is possible to populate the Analytics data by using the [Analytics API](./analytics-api.md). This requires access to Google Search Console and might not be needed if you are using the [Botify Crawl Import](botify.md).
