At the moment, only one language per import is supported, therefore if your feed contains multiple languages, use the Path to filter the language, e.g. **/en** . Then you can create another configuration for another language.

### 3. Create your Product Knowledge Graph
Link the website and import the data from the Merchant Feed to the website. To **create your Product Knowledge Graph** you need to add the script into your website.

Click **Finish**. Once you have completed these 3 steps, you will see that the **products** have been imported into the backend of your e-commerce website and **already enriched with structured data.**

From the WordLift dashboard, you can open the backend of your website and see the products imported and you can synchronize the data (it takes about 1 hour).

### Last Update 

The update of [Product Knowledge Graph Builder](https://wordlift.io/seo-for-non-wordpress-ecommerce/) added important elements to this feature:
- You can **reassign an existing merchant feed configuration to another Google account** that is not the same as the originally configured account. This way you have control over your data even if the platform was configured by someone else;
- In the PKG Builder configuration, you can **add a custom domain** and specify the dataset you want to use;
- You can check the **inport synchronization** at any time;
- **Change the "Seller Name."** This element, which cannot be edited in the Merchant Feed, is customizable in our Builder.

## IMPORTANT 
To ensure the proper implementation of structured data and Knowledge Graph, **it is crucial to effectively manage canonical links for products within the Google Merchant Center**. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how to accomplish this task, we highly recommend referring to Google's official documentation available at the [following link.](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9340054?hl=en)
