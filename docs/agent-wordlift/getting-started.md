- **Explore Queries:** Uncover the hidden potential of search queries. Understand how users search for topics related to your content and discover keywords you may want to target. Start simple and ask to the SEO Agent to <i>‚Äúanalyze the query ‚Äòsemantic seo‚Äô on google.com‚Äù</i> or <i>‚Äúshow me the entity gap between the query ‚Äòlinked data‚Äô and https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/linked-data/‚Äù</i>

- **Create Content:** Leverage your website content for new article creation: As mentioned, ask the Agent to <i>‚Äúsearch the website for ‚Äòthe impact of blockchain technology on finance‚Äô and using this insights, analyze the entities behind this query and create the outline for a new article.‚Äù</i> This will allow the Agent to analyze your website's content related to blockchain and finance, analyze the entities behind the top-ranking results on Google, and use all of this information to generate a new, informative article.
  
- **Expand Existing Content:** Enhance your existing content by automatically identifying and suggesting relevant entities that can be integrated seamlessly. This can improve the depth and context of your content, making it more engaging for readers and search engines. It is as simple as asking to <i>‚Äúexpand the content on https://wordlift.io/blog/en/entity/linked-data/ with entities like Google and Semantic Web‚Äù</i>.
